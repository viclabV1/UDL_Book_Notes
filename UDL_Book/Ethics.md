[[Artificial Intelligence]] will likely be one of the most impactful inventions ever. This can be good and bad. Some ethical considerations need to be taken, such as: 

[[Bias]] and [[Fairness]]: The [[Training Data]] that [[Deep Learning]] models are often trained on is most often subjective and biased, which the model will express in it's [[Output]].
[[Explainability]]: A [[Deep Neural Network]] is hard to dissect and explain, and thus it is hard to explain why it might reach a decision.
[[Weaponization]]: AI will doubtless be applied to war.
[[Power Concentration]]: The powerful companies and governments that control AI will gain even more power due to these systems. Profits will be high, and the rich will benefit and the poor will likely suffer due to labor displacement. 
[[Existential Risk]]: Terminator scenario, or maybe paperclips.

Many more concerns that will be explored in later chapters. 

It is hard to know exactly what will actually happen.
